        <h1>Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h1><hr>
        <p>You can write a paragraph in any way you want as long your content is inside the paragraph tag.<br>But keep in mind that your text will continue to be linear unless you use another tag to change it otherwise</p> 
        <p>You can break your paragraph using the tag "&lt;br&gt;" which I'll use to break the previous paragraph. <!--Keep going-->
